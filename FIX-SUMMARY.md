# MoPres Order Email System - Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved: Failed to send order emails - "Cannot find module 'puppeteer'"

### Key Changes Made

1. **Improved PDF Generation with Fallback Strategies**
   - Created a separate `generateInvoicePdf.ts` module with better error handling
   - Added robust module loading checks for Puppeteer
   - Implemented multiple fallback strategies:
     - Primary: Puppeteer for high-quality PDF generation
     - Secondary: PDFKit for simpler but functional PDF creation
     - Final Fallback: Minimal raw PDF generation as a last resort

2. **Enhanced Dependency Management**
   - Installed PDFKit as a fallback PDF generation library
   - Added better error handling for missing dependencies
   - Improved module loading with try/catch blocks

3. **Better Logging and Error Messages**
   - Added detailed step-by-step logging for the PDF generation process
   - Enhanced error reporting with more context about failures
   - Improved user-facing error messages on the client side

4. **Client-Side Error Handling**
   - Added better timeout handling for API requests
   - Added more robust response parsing for non-JSON responses
   - Improved user feedback with more specific toast messages

### How to Test

1. Access the application at http://localhost:3012
2. Navigate to the checkout confirmation page with a valid order
3. Click "Send Order Emails" 
4. The system will now gracefully handle missing dependencies and still generate a PDF invoice

### Technical Implementation

1. **Modular PDF Generation**
   - Split PDF generation into a separate module to better handle module loading errors
   - Implemented a progressive fallback strategy

2. **Safe Module Loading**
   - Added try/catch blocks for all module imports to prevent crashes
   - Added clear logging to diagnose issues

3. **Robust Client-Server Communication**
   - Improved request timeout handling
   - Better content-type checking and response validation

### Future Improvements

1. **Optional Dependencies**
   - Consider making Puppeteer an optional dependency in package.json
   - Add installation instructions in the README

2. **Pre-Generation Queue**
   - Pre-generate invoices for new orders rather than on-demand
   - Store generated PDFs in Supabase Storage for better reliability

3. **Email Service Monitoring**
   - Add detailed logging for email delivery status
   - Implement retry mechanism for failed email attempts

### Maintenance Notes

- If additional PDF generation issues occur, check:
  - Puppeteer installation (npm install puppeteer)
  - PDFKit installation (npm install pdfkit)
  - Resend API key configuration in .env.local

- For email delivery issues, check:
  - Resend API configuration
  - Email template rendering
  - Attachment size (should be under 10MB)

The order email system should now be much more robust and handle various edge cases gracefully, providing a better user experience even when dependencies are missing or other issues occur.
