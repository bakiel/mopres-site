# Admin Logout and Logo Display Fix

## Changes Made

This PR addresses two main issues:

1. **Admin Auto-Login Disabled by Default**
   - Fixed the admin authentication to require explicit login by default
   - Added a "Remember login" checkbox for users who want to enable auto-login
   - Enhanced logout functionality to properly clear all authentication states
   - Improved security by preventing automatic admin access

2. **Fixed Logo Display on Admin Login Page**
   - Corrected the image path from `/Mopres_Gold_luxury_lifestyle_logo.png` to `/logo.png`
   - Added the missing logo.png file to ensure the image displays correctly

3. **Fixed useSearchParams in Checkout Confirmation Page**
   - Corrected the search parameter name to match the expected `order_ref` parameter
   - Ensured proper Suspense boundary implementation to address Vercel deployment errors

4. **Added Docker Deployment Configuration**
   - Added Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized deployment
   - Updated next.config.js to support standalone output needed for Docker
   - Added deployment script for easy GitHub and Vercel deployment

## Testing Done

- Admin login page now consistently shows the logo
- Admin users are required to explicitly log in (no more auto-login by default)
- Admin users can opt to remember login with the checkbox
- Logout functionality properly clears all authentication data
- Built and tested with Docker locally
