Subject: Fix admin logout functionality to prevent auto-login after logout

This commit adds proper logout functionality to the admin panel:

1. Added a disable auto-login flag in localStorage that gets set when a user logs out
2. Modified the login pages to respect this flag and skip auto-login when explicitly logged out
3. Created a new LogoutButton component for easy integration
4. Added a standalone logout page at /admin/logout
5. Added logout button to the admin navigation

The changes fix an issue where users would be automatically logged back in 
after explicitly logging out, by adding proper state tracking for logout events.
