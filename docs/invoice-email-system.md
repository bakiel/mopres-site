# Invoice Email System for MoPres

## Overview

This system allows MoPres to automatically generate invoices and send them as email attachments to customers upon order completion.

## Key Features

1. **Server-side PDF Generation** - Invoices are generated on the server
2. **Email Attachments** - PDFs are automatically attached to order confirmation emails
3. **Standalone Resend Option** - Customers can request invoice emails from the confirmation page
4. **Correct Business Information** - All banking and company details are included

## Implementation

### Approach

We've implemented a server-first approach to invoice generation:

1. When an order is placed, the system automatically:
   - Creates a PDF invoice on the server
   - Stores it in Supabase storage
   - Attaches it to the confirmation email
   
2. On the confirmation page, customers can:
   - View their order details
   - Request the invoice to be resent if needed
   - View banking information for EFT payment

### Technical Components

1. **Edge Functions**:
   - `send-invoice-email-new` - Sends confirmation emails with PDF attachments
   - `upload-invoice` - Handles PDF storage in Supabase

2. **Storage**:
   - All invoices are stored in a dedicated `invoices` bucket
   - Naming convention: `invoice_[order_ref].pdf`

3. **Email Template**:
   - Professional HTML template with company branding
   - Includes order details and banking information
   - PDF invoice attached for customer records

## Testing

To test the invoice email functionality:

1. Run the test script:
   ```
   node scripts/test-invoice-email.js
   ```

2. This script will:
   - Find a recent order
   - Check if an invoice exists
   - Send a test email with the invoice attached
   - Report success or failure

## Benefits

This implementation provides several advantages:

1. **Reduced Client-side Load** - No heavy PDF generation on the browser
2. **Better User Experience** - No waiting for PDF generation
3. **Reliable Delivery** - Emails with attachments sent from server
4. **Consistent Branding** - Professional templates and formatting

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the future:

1. Add invoice number tracking in the database
2. Implement digital signatures for invoices
3. Provide a customer portal for accessing all past invoices
4. Add automatic payment receipt generation
