# Invoice PDF Compression & Email Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to the MoPres e-commerce platform to improve the invoice generation, compression, and email attachment process.

## Problem Statement

The original invoice PDF generation was causing large file sizes (up to 14MB), making it impractical to:
1. Attach to confirmation emails
2. Store efficiently in the database
3. Download quickly for customers

## Solution Overview

We implemented a comprehensive solution that:
1. Optimizes the invoice template to reduce complexity
2. Uses compression techniques to reduce PDF file size
3. Integrates PDF attachments with the confirmation email
4. Ensures all business/banking details are correct and consistent

## Implementation Details

### 1. Optimized Invoice Template

We created a new `InvoiceTemplateOptimized.tsx` component that:
- Reduces styling complexity
- Uses minimal HTML structure
- Optimizes the QR code size and quality
- Compresses text and layout spacing
- Avoids unnecessary high-resolution images

### 2. Simple PDF Utilities

We created a new `pdfUtils.js` utility with functions:
- `createInvoicePdf`: Creates optimized PDFs directly from HTML elements
- `blobToBase64`: Converts blobs to base64 strings for transfer

These utilities allow:
- Quality reduction to appropriate levels
- Image conversion from PNG to JPEG
- Resolution scaling to reduce file size
- Simple dynamic imports of required libraries

### 3. Updated Invoice Generation

In the `handleDownloadInvoice` function:
- Reduced canvas scale from 2.0 to 1.5
- Changed from PNG to JPEG with quality control
- Added PDF compression options
- Enabled a compression step before upload
- Added file size logging for debugging
- Triggered email with attachment after upload

### 4. Updated Edge Functions

#### send-invoice-email-new
- Added capability to detect attachment request
- Retrieves stored PDF from Supabase storage
- Attaches PDF to the confirmation email
- Enhanced email template with better formatting and styling
- Included all correct banking details

#### upload-invoice
- Added size validation to prevent oversized PDFs
- Improved error handling for large files
- Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Correct Banking Details

We synchronized all banking details across the platform:
- Bank: First National Bank (FNB)
- Account Holder: MoPres Fashion
- Account Number: 62792142095
- Account Type: GOLD BUSINESS ACCOUNT
- Branch Code: 210648
- Branch Name: JUBILEE MALL
- Swift Code: FIRNZAJU

## Dependencies

- Uses dynamic imports for html2canvas and jspdf
- No additional dependencies required
- Clean JavaScript implementation for maximum compatibility

## Testing

To test this implementation:
1. Complete a checkout process
2. On the confirmation page, click "DOWNLOAD INVOICE (PDF)"
3. Check the file size of the downloaded PDF (should be significantly smaller)
4. Check your email for the confirmation with the attached invoice

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:
- Server-side PDF generation instead of client-side
- Direct PDF creation rather than HTML-to-PDF conversion
- Additional compression options for very large orders
- PDF template customization in the admin panel

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise with the PDF compression:
- Check browser console logs for size reporting
- Verify that all required dependencies are installed
- Ensure proper Supabase storage bucket permissions
- Check Supabase Edge Function logs for detailed error information
