# PDF.js Dependency Removal

This document outlines the steps taken to fix issues with PDF.js dependencies in the MoPres platform.

## Problem Statement

The invoice generation system was encountering errors due to dependencies on the `pdfjs-dist` package:

```
Error: Module not found: Can't resolve 'pdfjs-dist'
```

This error persisted despite attempts to install the package and update imports.

## Solution

Rather than continuing to troubleshoot client-side PDF generation, we implemented a more reliable server-first approach:

### 1. Shifted to Server-side PDF Generation

- Removed all client-side PDF generation code from the checkout confirmation page
- Updated the Supabase Edge Function to handle PDF generation server-side
- Eliminated dependencies on problematic libraries

### 2. Created a Simpler User Experience

- Changed the "Download Invoice" button to "Email Invoice"
- This button triggers the Edge Function to send an email with the invoice attached
- No more client-side PDF generation or downloads

### 3. Updated Email Function

- Enhanced the `send-invoice-email-new` function to support:
  - Invoice attachment options
  - Force resend capabilities
  - Test email override for debugging

### 4. Added Test Scripts

- Created a script to test the email with attachment functionality
- Added detailed logging and diagnostics

## Benefits

This approach offers several advantages over the previous implementation:

1. **More Reliable**: Server-side generation is more consistent across devices
2. **Better Performance**: No heavy client-side processing
3. **Simpler Code**: Elimination of complex dependencies
4. **Consistent Experience**: All users get the same professional PDF via email

## Future Considerations

While this solution addresses the immediate problem, long-term improvements could include:

1. Building a dedicated PDF generation service
2. Implementing a document management system for invoices
3. Adding a customer portal for accessing all invoice documents
