# PDF Dependency Issue Resolution

## Problem

The project was encountering build errors due to dependencies on the `pdfjs-dist` package:

```
Error: Module not found: Can't resolve 'pdfjs-dist'
```

This error persisted despite multiple attempts to fix it through normal dependency management.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive fix with the following changes:

### 1. Server-First Approach for Order Confirmation

- Created a new confirmation page without client-side PDF generation
- Updated the server logic to handle invoice generation and email delivery
- Replaced "Download Invoice" button with "Email Invoice" functionality

### 2. Dynamic Import Pattern for Account Orders

- Modified `OrderDetailsClient.tsx` to use dynamic imports for PDF libraries
- Replaced static imports with runtime imports to prevent build-time dependency issues
- Updated the PDF generation with optimized settings for better performance

### 3. Template Optimization

- Switched all components to use the optimized invoice template
- Reduced rendering complexity and improved compression options
- Ensured consistent styling and formatting

### 4. Build Cleanup

- Removed the `.next` cache directory to eliminate stale references
- Updated the TypeScript configuration
- Eliminated all direct references to problematic libraries

## Benefits

This solution addresses the dependency issues while maintaining all functionality:

1. **Invoice Generation**: Still available in account order history
2. **Email Delivery**: Added as primary delivery mechanism from confirmation
3. **Banking Details**: All correctly displayed for payment
4. **Performance**: Improved with optimized rendering and compression

## Testing

The solution has been tested to ensure:

1. Order confirmation displays properly
2. Invoice emails deliver correctly
3. Order history page can generate PDFs on demand
4. All business information is correct and consistent

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/OrderDetailsClient.tsx`
2. `/src/app/checkout/confirmation/page.tsx`
3. `/src/utils/pdfUtils.js` (new file)
4. `/supabase/functions/send-invoice-email-new/index.ts`
5. `/docs/invoice-email-system.md` (new documentation)
6. `/docs/pdf-dependency-fix.md` (new documentation)

This approach provides a reliable solution that avoids the PDF.js dependency issues while maintaining all required functionality.
